Hello, my name is Ana Ortiz
Full stack programming student
- ðŸ”­ I am currently working on independent frontend development projects on web pages.
- ðŸŒ± I am currently starting my technical degree in programming at the National Technological University and studying javascript via Coderhouse.
- ðŸ‘¯ I'm looking for my first job as a web developer.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my skills in HTML, CSS and javascript.
- ðŸ“« How to contact me: anaclaraortiz1@gmail.com
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: Ann, Ani.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I think I always saw the world with the eyes of a programmer, I consider it very peculiar, that all life processes have a code to execute them, from preparing a tea to handling an airplane. Life itself is programming in different ways and programming is life.
